# Neural-Networks

Two Projects completed during a Neural Network class as part of Kaggle Competitions.

One is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that aims to classify images based on their features.

The other is a recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that aims to predict traffic volume using sequential hourly data.


The aim of these competition was to try various methods to design and improve the network to minimize error.


This involved extensive hyperparameter tuning and model development. Some of the methods attempted include chaning the number of neurons, layers, types of layers, adding dropout, and even combining a CNN with a RNN.
